These "labs" are intended as sandboxes to experiment with harder things, like face detection
and recognition, object detection, etc.  They are not intended to be complete applications.

All of these require SOURCE and OUTPUT environment variables to be set, and for now are only
really meant to be run via the IntelliJ IDEA IDE (run configurations are checked in).
